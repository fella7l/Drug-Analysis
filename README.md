Drug, Condition, and Effect Analysis with Excel
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the relationship between drugs, medical conditions, and their effects using Excel. By leveraging Excel's capabilities, we aim to gain insights into how different drugs interact with various conditions and their resulting effects.

Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis comprises information on drugs, medical conditions, and their corresponding effects. It includes data sourced from medical databases, clinical trials, and research studies.

Methodology
Data Acquisition: We collected the drug, condition, and effect data from reliable sources and organized it into a structured format suitable for analysis in Excel.
Data Cleaning and Preparation: The dataset underwent thorough cleaning and preparation within Excel to address any inconsistencies, missing values, or data errors.
Analysis: Using Excel's analytical features, we performed a comprehensive analysis to examine the relationships between drugs, conditions, and effects. This included exploring correlations, identifying patterns, and uncovering insights.
Visualization: Excel's visualization capabilities were utilized to create interactive dashboards that visualize the relationships between drugs, conditions, and effects. These dashboards offer dynamic and intuitive ways to explore the data.
Results
Our analysis yielded several key findings:

Identification of drugs commonly used to treat specific medical conditions
Analysis of the effects associated with different drugs
Exploration of potential interactions between drugs and conditions
Visualization of trends and patterns using interactive Excel dashboards
Conclusion
The drug, condition, and effect analysis conducted in Excel provides valuable insights into the complex relationship between drugs, medical conditions, and their effects. These insights can be used by healthcare professionals, researchers, and policymakers to make informed decisions and improve patient outcomes.
